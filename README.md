# Patch Microstrip Antenna – MATLAB Solutions  

These are the solution codes for the home tasks on **Patch Microstrip Antenna (MATLAB Code)**.  

## Suggestions
1. It’s better to do the tasks separately. – otherwise it’ll be hard to understand the output figures.  
2. Avoid using **`subplot`** – the output figures may not look in the right shape.  
3. These codes are meant as an **emergency solution**. Don’t just copy them without understanding – you won’t really learn that way.  
4. Always check the **Antenna_Fig.pdf** to make sure your output figures are correct.
